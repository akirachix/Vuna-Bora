# About the project
Maize production has declined in Kenya due to soil infertility, which has been a major contributor to the decline.
The project aims to help Kenyan small-scale maize farmers improve their soil fertility in order to boost yields. As a result, they will be able to earn a living and better their living conditions.
The project aim is to use IoT to create a device that will help farmers check their soil Ph level, which should be between 6.0 and 7.0, as well as whether the NPK in the soil is balanced.If the soil Ph is not between the given range then the device is able to calculate the remaining percentage of Ph and display the results to the farmer.This device will help farmers in balancing the soil NPK and also mantain the level of soil Ph in the soil.This will reduce the low production of maize that farmers get from using high or low fertilizers in their farms since the device will be able to give the farmer the accurate measurements of fertilizer to put in the soil.
